                <h1>ABOUT</h1>
                <p>Young Kim was born in Seoul to Korean parents in the early 60's.</p>
                <p>Until the age of twelve, Seoul was Young's home, and the only cultural reference. Following an emigration to the United States, Young then spent his adolescence and early adulthood in the United States where he came to identify as being Korean-American.</p>
                <p>The successive experiences in Seoul and America left Young possessed by two distinctive cultures under one skin; to him, neither fitting very well. He considered himself to be as American. However, in the eyes of others, he was, by all appearances, "Asian".</p>
                <p>After achieving a successful creative career in U.S. advertising industry, Young relocated to Tokyo in the 90's, taking on another challenge in his career path.</p>
                <p>Ironically enough, in returning to Asia, Young found his alienation on a par with that of which he endured in America, only in reverse. His face fit, his persona did not. Dressing up as Suitman gave Young the strength to confront the feeling of socio-cultural isolation and empowered him to explore his true identity.</p>
                <p>Suitman is Young's living art created through his experience of living the life as Suitman. Together, Suitman and Young Kim have traveled through six continents, over hundreds of destination, interacting with all walks of life, gathering inspiration for their work comprises photography, film, installation, performance and design object. Their work is insightful, highly engaging, surprising and always with a sense of humor. To view latest Suitman art work and exhibition, please visit 'photography' & 'exhibition' sessions of this site.</p>
                <p>When putting his Reggae selector's hat on, Suitman is also known as Rasta Tiger.</p>
